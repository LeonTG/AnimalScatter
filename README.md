# AnimalScatter

**Description:**

Scatter animals around the map if they won't spawn natural, I mostly made this release incase anyone else had the issiue like arctic does at the moment. This was also being used as a temp solution to no natual animals on arctic.

The scattered uses the minecraft worldborder radius and it does not scatter outside of it.

**Commands:**

/ascatter [world] [amount] - *Scatter animals around the map, 500 amount is reccomended but it depends on your map size.*

**Permissions:**

*uhc.config* - Permission to use /ascatter, reasoning for the name is so hosts on arctic would get access to it.
