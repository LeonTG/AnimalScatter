# AnimalScatter

**Description:**

Scatter animals around the map if they won't spawn natural, I mostly made this release incase anyone else had the issue like ArcticUHC does at the moment. This was also being used as a temporary solution to no animals spawning on ArcticUHC.

The scatter uses the Minecraft Worldborder's radius and it does not scatter outside of it.

**Commands:**

/ascatter [world] [amount] - *Scatter animals around the map. 500 is recommended for amount, but it depends on the map size.*

**Permissions:**

*uhc.config* - Permission to use /ascatter. The permission name is so hosts on ArcticUHC would get access to use it.
